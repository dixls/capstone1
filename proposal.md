# Check Out This Song: Project Proposal

"Check Out This Song" is a web app designed to let users share songs they're enjoying. Users can follow other users and see their songs in a feed, and can 'like' songs they enjoy. 

* This site is for anyone who enjoys music, but is especialy targeting people who enjoy sharing new music with their friends online. Likely people ages 18-35
* This site will use music information data, likely from a music specific database, as well as most likely Youtube to show a playable embed of the songs chosen.
